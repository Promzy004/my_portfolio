                            I'm a full stack developer. I've been a fanatic of computers since time immemorial, and i loved math (I can't figure out why I don't love it anymore). Anyways, i wrote my first line of code in 2019! thanks to zuck. I'm a yapper and introvert who writes less, so here is my blog . I hope i soon talk less and write more!
